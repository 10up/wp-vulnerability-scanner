## Installation

### Global command, automatically

It can be installed as a wp-cli package via git repo which is the most preferred way to install.

```
wp package install 10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner:dev-trunk
```

### API Access
WP-CLI Vulnerability Scanner works with [WPScan](https://wpscan.com), [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/) and [Wordfence Intelligence](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/) to check reported vulnerabilities; you can choose any one of these three to use. You will need to add a constant in your `wp-config.php` to decide which API service you want to use (by default **WPScan API** will be used).

To use **WPScan API**:
```
define( 'VULN_API_PROVIDER', 'wpscan' );
```

To use **Patchstack API**:
```
define( 'VULN_API_PROVIDER', 'patchstack' );
```

To use **Wordfence Intelligence API**:
```
define( 'VULN_API_PROVIDER', 'wordfence' );
```
***Note**: Authentication is not required for the Wordfence Intelligence Vulnerability API ( https://www.wordfence.com/wti-community-edition-terms-and-conditions/ ). VULN_API_TOKEN is not required if using Wordfence as your provider.*

For WPScan and Patchstack you will need to register for a user account and supply an API token from the chosen API service. Once you have acquired the token, you can add it as a constant in wp-config.php as follows:

```
define( 'VULN_API_TOKEN', 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' );
```


### Global command, manually

Clone this repo, checkout to stable branch and require `wpcli-vulnerability-scanner.php` from wp-cli config.  E.g. in `~/.wp-cli/config.yml` [[other config locations](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/references/config/#config-files)]

```
require:
  - /path/to/this/repo/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner.php
```

### Standard plugin

This repo can be installed as a regular plugin. There is no UI, but the command will become available.

```
wp plugin install --activate https://github.com/10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner/archive/stable.zip
```

After plugin installation, you can verify the command is in place with `wp help vuln`

### Example output

#### Checking plugins and themes for reported vulnerabilities:

```shell
$ wp vuln status

Vulnerability API Provider: WPScan
WordPress 6.2.2
+-----------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+----------+
| name      | installed version | status                                                    | introduced in | fixed in |
+-----------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+----------+
| WordPress | 6.2.2             | No vulnerabilities reported for this version of WordPress | n/a           | n/a      |
+-----------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+----------+
```

Using the JSON format:

```shell
$ wp vuln status --format=json

{"core":[{"name":"WordPress","installed version":"6.2.2","status":"No vulnerabilities reported for this version of WordPress","introduced in":"n\/a","fixed in":"n\/a"}],"plugins":
```

#### Checking any given theme:

```shell
$ wp vuln theme-check twentyfifteen --version=1.1

+------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| name                   | installed version | status                                                       | fixed in |
+------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| twentyfifteen          | 1.1               | Twenty Fifteen Theme <= 1.1 - DOM Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | 1.2      |
+------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
```

Using the JSON format:

```json
$ wp vuln theme-check twentyfifteen --version=1.1 --format=json

[{"name":"twentyfifteen","installed version":"1.1","status":"Twenty Fifteen Theme <= 1.1 - DOM Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)","fixed in":"1.2"}]
```

### Example usage

**Basic**

```
wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain)
```

Will simply error out if there are no slugs returned by the `plugin-status` command. Can suppress the output by appending ` &> /dev/null`

```
wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```

**Scheduled/Cron**

```
0 0 * * * wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
0 0 * * * wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```

`0 0 * * *` is everyday at midnight. For assistance creating an alternate schedule, check out [http://crontab.guru/](http://crontab.guru/). For example, `0 0 * * 1,4` runs at midnight every Monday and Thursday.

**With email notifications**

Included is a sample bash script, `includes/vuln.sh`. This can be customized and used in a cron job so that you can be alerted when vulnerabilities are found.

 * `WPCLIPATH` should be the full path to your wp command. The script will attempt to discover this automatically if the given filename does not exist

 * `RECIPIENT` should be an email address which will receive the notifications
 * `SUBJECT` is the email subject

This readme does not discuss configuring the `mail` command on your server. To run a simple test, try

```
echo "This is the body text" | mail -s "Email subject" you@domain.com

```

**Nagios**

`wp vuln plugin-status --nagios` will give output for Nagios monitoring.

## Check uninstalled themes and plugins

Check a specific version of a theme or plugin. Example:

```
wp vuln theme-check twentyfifteen --version=1.1
```

Or check several at once (cannot accept versions)

```
wp vuln plugin-check wppizza wordpress-seo
```

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites:

Must have environment variables for VULN_API_PROVIDER and VULN_API_TOKEN

To run tests against **WPScan API**:

```
export VULN_API_PROVIDER='wpscan'
export VULN_API_TOKEN='Your API Token Here'
```

To run tests against **Patchstack API**:

```
export VULN_API_PROVIDER='patchstack'
export VULN_API_TOKEN='Your API Token Here'
```

To run tests against **Wordfence Intelligence API**, VULN_API_TOKEN is not required:

```
export VULN_API_PROVIDER='wordfence'
```

### Install dependencies

```
composer prepare-tests
```

*Note: Not uncommon for composer to run out of memory, you may need to take steps to free up memory on your end*

### Run tests
**WPScan API**
```
composer behat -- features/vuln-wpscan.feature
```

**PatchStack API**
```
composer behat -- features/vuln-patchstack.feature
```

**Wordfence API**
```
composer behat -- features/vuln-wordfence.feature
```
